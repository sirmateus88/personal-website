              <h2>About Me</h2>
              I graduated from Colby College with a degree in math in 2012. Since then I have worked at B2B companies
              working with teams to build solutions that solve complex business problems and provide data to answer
              important questions.

              <h2>What I’ve worked on</h2>
              As a Product Manager - Business Intelligence Lead at Mariana Tek, I worked on a variety of projects spanning
              a large enterprise class software product. My main role was to act as Product Owner and Product Expert on a
              variety of features within our business and consumer facing products. Some highlights below:
              <ul>
                  <li>- Guided Mariana Tek Software from idea to launch, resulting in Mariana’s first recurring revenue and contracts signed with 2 national brands.</li>
                  <li>- Implemented creative and lean solutions to payroll and label printing, saving over a month of development time on launching Barry’s Bootcamp while reducing Barry’s time spent doing payroll by almost 2 workdays.</li>
                  <li>- Drove user experience improvements to inventory management, leading to a greater than 5-fold increase in usage.</li>
              </ul>


              As a Senior Product Management Associate at Alarm.com, I focused on tools for our business customers. My main role was to own the reporting roadmap and implement features to help security dealers manage their customer base. Some highlights below:
              <ul>
                  <li>- Using the signal rating and other analysis, I worked to implement a feature that reduced false alarms for the Alarm.com crash and smash product by half.</li>
                  <li>- Created a network suggestion tool for dealers installing cellular radios that became one of the most commonly accessed areas of the dealer website.</li>
                  <li>- Work with a team of engineers and product managers to create a mobile and web based business intelligence application for our dealer base, which was often credited as a key factor in acquiring new dealers and keeping old ones.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>What I’m looking to do next</h2>
              I am looking to make a difference in a strategically focused product role at a company that shares my values. I love to learn, and I think there is no better way to learn than by shipping product! I want to work for a company that loves to innovate and embraces the "fail fast" startup ethos. I would love to be in an analytics focused roll or to work on a consumer product, but there is a lot that I find interesting and I love to learn new things!
